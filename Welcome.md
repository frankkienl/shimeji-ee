# Introduction #

Hi, I started the Shimeji-ee project.  I came across Shimeji and thought it was pretty nifty.  I wanted to make a new image set and give it to my cousin for her birthday.  I decided that, seeing how the source was available, I might as well update the menus to be in English for her.  That was the beginning of my downfall.

Due to its customability, Shimeji was more complicated than I thought and had much more Japanese than I thought (those XML files!.)  With the help of my rusty college Japanese and Google Translate, I was eventually able to (poorly) translate the code and build a new executable.  By that point, I had already dumped a fair number of hours into the project, so I figured, why not spend another few evenings on it.  I quickly tacked on some additional features (multiple Shimeji type support and some sloppy behavior forcing) and threw it up on Google Project for the good of all.

I've already put way more time than I intended into this project as it is and intend to mostly step away.  I'm hoping that other people will chip in to add more features, naturalize the translation, and fix any bugs.  Shimeji is actually very customizable, so I'm really hoping people add some guides to the wiki and create new configurations/image sets.  Customizing Shimeji is definitely not easy.  It's really easy to write a bad configuration and not know why.

Good luck and have fun with Shimeji-ee.  Contribute if you have time, new image sets and guides would REALLY be nice.  Remember to thank Yuki Yamada for the original source, I'm glad I didn't have to do this from scratch.
