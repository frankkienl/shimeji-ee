Shimeji is a Windows desktop mascot that freely wanders and plays around the screen.  The mascot is very configurable; its actions are defined through xml and its animations/images can be customized.  Shimeji was originally created by Yuki Yamada of Group Finity (<a href='http://www.group-finity.com/Shimeji/'><a href='http://www.group-finity.com/Shimeji/'>http://www.group-finity.com/Shimeji/</a></a>).  This branch of the original Shimeji project not only translates the program/source to English, but aims to additionally enhance Shimeji as well.

Find Downloads on the Download page.  There are two versions, Calm and Mischievous. The only difference is their configuration files.  The Mischievous version will divide itself and toss around non-full screen browser windows, the Calm version only walks around.  The recommended version is mischievous: <a href='http://shimeji-ee.googlecode.com/files/Shimeji-ee_1.0.3_Mischievous.zip'><a href='http://shimeji-ee.googlecode.com/files/Shimeji-ee_1.0.3_Mischievous.zip'>http://shimeji-ee.googlecode.com/files/Shimeji-ee_1.0.3_Mischievous.zip</a></a>

To see the changes between versions of the program, please see <a href='http://code.google.com/p/shimeji-ee/wiki/Changelog'>the changelog.</a>  The last change was made on November 12, 2010.  It decreased the memory used by Shimeji-ee.

For information on converting old Shimeji configuration to English for Shimeji-ee, read the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/shimeji-ee/wiki/ConvertingShimeji'>Convert Shimeji</a> wiki page.

For more information, see the wiki section or read the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/shimeji-ee/wiki/Readme'>readme</a> that comes with the program.

As for naming guidelines, the program is called Shimeji-ee and the individual mascots are called Shimeji.  There can be several Shimeji types at once if you use multiple image sets, but most computers probably can't handle more than 5 types at once.

Like Shimeji, Shimeji-ee requires A LOT of memory.  If any programmers would like to take a look at it and cut down the memory usage, that would be very useful.  Look at the issues page for more detail.
